You are given two directories: dir1 and dir2.
each directory contain several files and sub directories inside.
For example:
dir1
dir1/file1
dir1/file2
dir1/sub_dir1
dir1/sub_dir1/fileA
dir1/sub_dir2
dir1/sub_dir2/fileZ
 
dir2
dir2/file1
dir2/file2
dir2/sub_dir1
dir2/sub_dir1/fileA
dir2/sub_dir3
dir2/sub_dir3/fileB
 
You will need combine dir1 and dir2 into a new directory named 'new_dir'
if you see a file in dir1 and a file in dir2 have the same filename, please rename the file from dir2 (for example, 'file1' -> 'file1_2'). The same rule will apply to the files inside a sub directory as well.
After the combination, dir1 and dir2 should be removed and new_dir will be the only directory left.
