You are given a very large file that cannot fit into memory. The file has following content:
This is a line
This is a line
This is a short line
This is a loooong line
This not is a line
This is a line
This is a loooong line
This not is a line
This is a loooong line
This not is a line
This is a line
This is a short line
This is a line
This is a short line
 
There are so many duplicated lines and you will need to remove them and return a new file that only contains unique lines. Assume all unique lines will fit in memory.
